         <p>I am a coding Instructor at WhiteHat Jr. and I've worked in basic game designing using the p5.play.js, p5.js and matter.js libraries in JavaScript. I am not from computer science background <br> but as I believe in continuous learning so my teaching and learning goes simultaneously. <br>       
            Just want to learn and grow more. </p>
